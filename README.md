# Mandelbrot Visualizer

A simple Mandelbrot set visualiser built using C++ and SFML. The application allows for interactive zooming and panning of the Mandelbrot fractal, showcasing beautiful fractal patterns.

## Features

- **Interactive Zooming**: Zoom in and out using keyboard controls (z for zoom in and x for zooming out).
- **Panning**: Move around the fractal with arrow keys.
- **High Iteration Count**: Supports a high number of iterations for detailed rendering and it is dynamically increased as you zoom in.
- **Dynamic Color Mapping**: Experience different color mappings for visual effects.
